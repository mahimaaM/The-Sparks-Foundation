### TASK-2: Color Identification in Images

#### OBJECTIVE:
 1. Color Identification is a simple application to recognize color.
 2. In this Project we extracted colors from images using the basics of OpenCV, KMeans algorithm and filtered images from a collection of images based on RGB values of colors. 
 3. With the help of image processing, the program had been made which can detect extract colors using KMeans algorithm and then use this to search images based on colors.
